## Architecture Overview


###  Architecture Pattern
- **Component-Based Frontend**: React-based modular design improves maintainability and reusability.
- **Serverless Backend**: Firebase handles authentication, data, and real-time updates‚Äîeliminating the need for manual server management.

## üß™ Testing


- **Unit Testing**: Basic Jest test on the profile component to verify proper rendering and logic
- **Integration Testing**: Postman used to simulate user interaction and data flow, particularly around posting, liking, and authentication
- Future plans include expanding test coverage with real-time simulation and edge case validation

## üìå Setup Instructions


### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.cim.rhul.ac.uk/wlis116/PROJECT.git
cd social-shout

### 2. Install Dependencies

```

```

### üêõ Common Issues & Fixes 
####  Case Sensitivity Error on Some Operating Systems If the app fails to compile with an error like:
 ``` Module not found: Error: Cannot find file: 'user.js' does not match the corresponding name on disk: './User.js' ``` 


This means that the **import path is case-sensitive** and must match the actual file name. 


**Fix**: Open the file `src/components/sidebar/index.js` and update the import statement: 
```js // Change this: import User from './user'; // To this: import User from './User'; ``` This resolves the mismatch between the import and the actual file name, especially on case-sensitive file systems like Linux. 

  #### üåø Main Branch Not Running? If you're facing issues running the app from the `main` branch (e.g., build errors or missing features), it might be outdated. ‚úÖ **Fix**: Switch to the latest stable development branch: 
```bash git checkout notification-dev 
``` 
This branch includes the most up-to-date features and working codebase.
